### 🚀 My Research Focus

- 🔭 My core research revolves around **Large Language Models for Code**, with a focus on three key areas:
  1.  **🤖 Code Generation:** Exploring novel techniques for generating accurate and efficient code.
  2.  **🌐 Code Translation:** Developing models for seamless translation between programming languages.
  3.  **🔍 LLM Interpretability:** Uncovering the "why" behind model decisions in code-related tasks.

- 💬 Feel free to discuss anything related to these topics, Python, or PyTorch!
